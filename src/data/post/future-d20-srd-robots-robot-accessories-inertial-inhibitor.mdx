## Inertial Inhibitor (PL 7)


The inertial inhibitor generates a thin magnetic field that radiates out from the robot, slowing the velocity of potentially damaging weapons and projectiles. The robot gains damage reduction 5/energy (the inertial inhibitor does not protect against attacks that deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic/concussion damage). The inertial inhibitor feeds on of the robotÂ’s internal power source.
