    Skeletal Reinforcement [MAJOR]




    Your bones become more resilient, allowing you withstand greater amounts of punishment.




    MP Cost: 5.




    Benefits: Your massive damage threshold increases by +3. In addition, the damage you take from a fall is reduced by one die.




    Special: This mutation stacks with the Improved Damage Threshold feat. You cannot take this mutation if you have the Brittle Bones drawback.
