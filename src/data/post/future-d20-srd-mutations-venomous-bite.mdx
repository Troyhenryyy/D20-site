## 
     Venomous Bite [MAJOR]
    



     Your natural bite attack injects poison into your victimÂ’s bloodstream.
    



     MP Cost: 4.
    



     Benefit: Any creature you successfully hit with your bite attack must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your level + your Constitution
modifier) to negate the effects (initial and secondary damage 1d4 Con).
    



     Special: You must have a natural bite attack to gain the benefit of this mutation. You cannot take this mutation if you have the Acidic Saliva mutation.
