## Festering Sores [DRAWBACK]

Your skin is covered with painful, festering sores.

MP Value: 2.

Drawback: The festering sores are more aggravating than harmful, but they make it especially hard to wear armor. When you wear any type of armor, decrease the armors maximum Dexterity bonus by 2 and increase its armor penalty by +4.
