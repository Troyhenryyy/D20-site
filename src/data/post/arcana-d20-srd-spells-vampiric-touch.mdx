## Vampiric Touch


Necromancy


Level: Arcane 3, Divine 3; Components: V, S; Casting Time: Attack action; Range: Touch; Target: Living creature touched; Duration: Instantaneous and 1 hour (see text); Saving Throw: None; Spell Resistance: Yes


You must succeed at a melee touch attack. Your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. However, you cant gain more than the targets current hit points +10, which is enough to kill the target. The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later.
