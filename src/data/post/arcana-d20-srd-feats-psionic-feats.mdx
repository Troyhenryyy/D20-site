## 
    Psionic Feats
   



    Some spell-related feats are equally applicable to psionics. The following psionic feats function as the named spell-related feats. Treat references to spells as powers within these descriptions, and references to caster level as manifester level.
   


| Power Penetration | As Spell Penetration |
| :------------------- | ----------------------: |
| Power Focus | As Spell Focus |
| Great Power Penetration | As Greater Spell Penetration |
| Greater Power Focus | As Greater Spell Focus |




    Feats that require the choice of a school of spells would for its psionic equivalent require choosing an attribute (ability score), to the same overall effect. In addition, metapsionic feats function in much the same way as metamagic feats. However, they require the additional expenditure of power points (as opposed to increased spell levels) and as a result are presented here.
