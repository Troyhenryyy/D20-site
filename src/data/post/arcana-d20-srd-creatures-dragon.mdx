     Dragon




     All dragons speak their own language, Draconic. They speak a number of additional languages equal to their Intelligence bonus.

###

     Species Traits




     Dragons have the following traits:




     Age Categories: Dragons have twelve age categories that broadly define most of their statistics, including size, Hit Dice, Defense, attacks, and special abilities. As a dragon ages, it grows more powerful, as defined in Table: Dragon Age Categories.




     Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it cant breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at the dragons mouth and extends in a direction of the dragons choice, with an area as noted in Table: Dragon Breath Weapon Range. If the breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage; the DC depends on the dragons age. Saves against nondamaging breath weapons use the same DC, but arent necessarily Reflex saves.




     Breath weapons are either cones (which are as high and wide as they are long) or lines (5 feet high and 5 feet wide).




     Each dragon has one breath weapon, which is associated with the color of its scales and its allegiance to good or evil.




     Fear Aura (Ex): A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet x the dragons age category are subject to the effect if they have fewer Hit Dice than the dragon.

A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC noted in Table: Dragon Age Categories) remains immune to that dragons fear aura for one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the fear aura of other dragons.

     Crush (Ex): A flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size can land on opponents as an attack action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more sizes smaller than the dragon (though it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger opponents).




     A crush attack affects as many cratures as can fit under the dragons body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC noted in Table: Dragon Age Categories) or be pinned and automatically take the listed damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take crush damage each round if they dont escape.




     Grappling: A dragon can always use its breath weapon while grappling, as well as its spells and spell-like or supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds at Concentration checks.




     If grappled by a creature the same size or larger, a dragon can attack the grappling creature with its bite and all four limbs (each doing claw damage). If

crushed by a larger dragon, a dragon can respond only with grapple attacks, or with bite or breath weapon attacks. If grappled by a creature smaller than itself, the dragon can respond with any of its physical attacks other than a tail sweep.

     Tail Sweep (Ex): A dragon of at least Gargantuan size can sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affect a half circle with a diameter of 30 feet, centered on the dragons rear. A Colossal dragons tail sweep has a 40-foot radius.




     Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more sizes smaller than the dragon. The sweep deals the damage listed in Table: Dragon Age

Categories; a successful Reflex save halves the damage.

     Spells: A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a Mage of the level indicated on Table: Dragon Spells and Spell-like Abilities, gaining bonus spells for a high Intelligence score.




     Spell-Like Abilities: A young or older dragon gains a spell-like ability upon reaching its new age category, as noted in Table: Dragon Spell-like Abilities. Once the dragon selects a spell-like ability for a given age category, it cannot swap that ability for another. The dragon retains all previously selected spell-like abilities and uses its age category as its caster level. The save DC is 10 + the dragons Charisma modifier + spell level.




     Spell Resistance (Ex): As dragons age, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as listed in Table: Dragon Age Categories.




     Immunities (Ex): All dragons are immune to sleep and paralysis effects. Dragons are also immune to certain energy types depending on their color:

Black, green, and copper dragons are immune to acid.

     Blue and bronze dragons are immune to electricity.




     Red, brass, and gold dragons are immune to fire and take 50% more damage against cold-based attacks on a failed save.




     White and silver dragons are immune to cold and take 50% more damage against fire-based attacks on a failed save.




     Blindsight (Ex): A dragon can ascertain creatures by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by noticing vibration and other environmental clues) with a range of 30 feet x the dragons age category.




     Keen Senses (Ex): A dragon has low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 100 feet x the dragons age category.
