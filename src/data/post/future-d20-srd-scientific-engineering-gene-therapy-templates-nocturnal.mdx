## Nocturnal (Template)


Nocturnal is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the character). It uses all the characters statistics and special abilities except as noted here.


The nocturnal template allows the character to function in darkness the way normal humans do in the light. A character acquires the nocturnal template by undergoing a course of gene therapy (see More Human than Human). The regimen requires 25 successful Fortitude saving throws (DC 20).


Special Qualities: A nocturnal retains all the special qualities of the character and gains the additional special qualities listed below.


Darkvision (Ex): Nocturnals have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.


Light Sensitivity (Ex): Nocturnals are blinded by sunlight, flashlights, fluorescent lights, halogen lamps, and other sources of bright illumination. They can counter the blindness and see normally by wearing dark-tinted sunglasses or tinted visors.


Skills: Same as the character, with a +2 species bonus on Listen and Move Silently checks.


Feats: Nocturnals gain Blind-Fight as a bonus feat.


Advancement: By character class.
