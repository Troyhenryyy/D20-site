## Hair Trigger


You have developed a delicate sense of timing, and your area attacks hit your foes when theyÂ’re ill-prepared to defend against them.


Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +6.


Benefit: Whenever you make an attack from your mecha that requires enemies to make Reflex saving throws, the DC for such saves is increased by +2.
