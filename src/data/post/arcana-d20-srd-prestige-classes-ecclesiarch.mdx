### 
     Class Features
    



     The following features pertain to the Ecclesiarch prestige class.
    



     Total Spellcasting
    

     Count all character levels when determining the Ecclesiarchs casting level for divine spells.
    



     Increased Spells/Day
    

     At 2nd level, the Ecclesiarch increases the base number of divine spells he may cast per day by one-half (round down). This increase occurs before modifications for high Wisdom or other alterations. At 4th level, the Ecclesiarch again increases the number of divine spells available per day, this time to a total of twice what he would normally have. As before, this increase happens prior to any modifications or alterations.
    



     Total Turning
    

     Count all character levels when determining the Ecclesiarchs level for attempts to turn, rebuke, or command creatures.
    



     Innovative Turning
    

     When the Ecclesiarch gains 5th level, and every time he gains a character level above this, he may spend an action point to alter the creature type he can turn, rebuke, or command. One Ecclesiarch may choose to affect fey, while another may affect constructs, and a third may choose to affect dragons. The new creature type replaces that of the previous one, and all limitations to the previous power apply (if the character could not bolster the previous creature type, he cannot bolster the new creature type). Certain types of creatures have restrictions on how they may be affected. The types that may be affected are:
    


| Aberrations | Humans * |
| :------------- | ----------: |
| Animals | Magical beasts** |
| Constructs | Monstrous humanoids* |
| Dragons** | Oozes |
| Elementals | Outsiders** |
| Fey* | Plants |
| Giants* | Undead |
| Humanoids* | Vermin |
| *This type of creature cannot be destroyed by turning, regardless of the success of the turning.
        
        **This type of creature cannot be destroyed by turning, and cannot be commanded. |  |
