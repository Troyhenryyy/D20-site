     Sensor Baffling




     From simple metal detectors to advanced x-ray scanners, thereÂ’s a way to detect every weapon. As the technology level increases, so does the accuracy of weapons sensing devices. The ability to confuse these sensors can be invaluable, especially when smuggling weapons past security. Any weapon with the sensor baffling gadget grants a +4 bonus on any checks made to conceal the weapon from sensors or other detection devices.
