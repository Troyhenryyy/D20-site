## Call Weaponry


Dexterity [Teleportation]


Level: Telepath 1/Psionic Agent 1; Display: Audible, Material; Manifestation Time: Attack action; Range: Touch; Effect: 1 unattended weapon (see text); Duration: 1 hour/level (see text) (D); Saving Throw: None; Power Resistance: No; Power Points: 1 (see text)


You call a weapon �from thin air� into your waiting hand (actually, it is a real weapon hailing from some other random location) as a free action. You don�t have to see or know of a weapon to call it�in fact, you can�t ever call a specific weapon. You just specify the type. If the specified weapon type is one you can call at your level, it appears. If you call a projectile weapon, it comes loaded with a clip, box, or chamber of ammunition, as appropriate (the ammunition does not have an enhancement bonus, even at 10th level and above). If you relinquish your grip on the weapon you called for 2 or more rounds, it automatically returns to wherever it originally came from.


As your level increases, you can summon better weapons, although the power point cost is also greater.


| Level | Weapons | Example | Power Points |
| :------- | :---------: | :---------: | --------------: |
| 1�3 | Simple melee | Knife | 1 |
| 4�6 | Handgun | Colt Python | 3 |
| 7�9 | SMG, rifle, shotgun | Winchester 94 | 7 |
| 10 | Exotic or Archaic melee | Katana | 11 |



Weapons gained by call weaponry are distinctive due to the low hum they emit.
