## Light Sensitivity [DRAWBACK]

Your eyes cannot adjust to bright light.

MP Value: 1.

Drawbacks: Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight) blinds you for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, you take a Â–1 penalty on attack rolls, Search checks, and Spot checks as long as you remainin the affected area.
