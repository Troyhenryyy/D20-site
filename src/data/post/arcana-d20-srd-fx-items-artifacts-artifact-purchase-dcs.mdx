## 
     Artifact Purchase DCs
    



     Artifacts cannot generally be purchased on the open market, although a careless vendors might sell one inadvertantly (by failing to realize its true nature or power). Since artifacts are often unique items, one must strike a deal with the current owner (who usually demands an exorbitant price). Players may not equip their characters with artifacts without their GMs permission.
    



     For the purposes of reward values, an artifacts purchase DC is 30 + its FX modifier. The FX modifier depends on the items nature, as shown below:
    


| Artifact Effects | FX Modifier |
| :------------------ | -------------: |
| Each single-use effect |  |
| Each continuous effect, permanent effect, or +3 enhancement bonus | +10 |
| Each effect with a limited number of uses per day, or each +2 enhancement bonus | +7 |
| Each effect with a limited number of charges, or each +1 enhancement bonus | +5 |
