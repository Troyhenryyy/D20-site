## 
     Extend Spell [Metamagic]
    



     You can cast spells that last longer than normal.
    




      Benefit:
     
     An extended spell lasts twice as long as normal. Spells with a concentration, instantaneous, or permanent duration are not affected by this feat.
    



     An extended spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spellÂ’s actual level.
