     Empower Turning




     You can turn or rebuke (or awe or command) more creatures with a single turning check.





      Prerequisite:

     Ability to turn or rebuke one or more creature types, Charisma 13.





      Benefit:

     If you take a Â–2 penalty on your roll to turn or rebuke (or awe or command) a group of creatures, you can add +2d6 to your turning damage roll.
