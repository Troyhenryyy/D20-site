     Class Features




     The following features pertain to the Thrasher advanced class.




     Tough Defense


     Using his constitution instead of his dexterity, the Thrasher applies his Constitution bonus to his Defense instead of his Dexterity bonus. Any situation that would deny the Thrasher his Dexterity bonus to Defense denies the Constitution bonus.




     Ability Surge


     At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, the Thrasher can temporarily increase his Strength and Dexterity, but at a penalty to saving throws. The Thrasher gains a +4 morale bonus to both Strength and Dexterity, but takes a 2 penalty on all saving throws. Activating ability surge is a free action, and the surge lasts for as many rounds as the character has Thrasher levels. Following an ability surge, the Thrasher is fatigued (2 to Strength and Dexterity) for as many rounds as he surged, but may negate this penalty as a free action by spending an action point.




     The Thrasher may use the ability surge once per day at 2nd level, twice per day at 5th level, and three times per day at 8th level.




     Bonus Feats


     At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Thrasher gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Thrasher must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.




     Alertness, Blind-Fight, Brawl, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Far Shot, Focused, Great Cleave, Improved Brawl, Improved Knockout Punch, Improved Trip, Knockout Punch, Power Attack.




     Uncanny Dodge X


     The Thrasher gains the ability of Uncanny Dodge, or increases the potency of this ability if he already has it.




     If the Thrasher does not have Uncanny Dodge 1 (usually gained as a Fast hero), he gains Uncanny Dodge 1: He retains his Dexterity bonus to Defense (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by a hidden attacker. (He still loses his Dexterity bonus to Defense if hes immobilized.)




     If the Thrasher already has Uncanny Dodge 1, he gains Uncanny Dodge 2: He can no longer be flanked; he can react to opponents on opposite sides of himself as easily as he can react to a single attacker.




     If the Thrasher already has Uncanny Dodge 2, then he gains no further benefit from this ability.




     Damage Reduction


     Starting at 7th level, the Thrasher gains the ability to use the ambient magic around him to shrug off some amount of injury from each attack. The Thrasher gains damage reduction 5/+1. Subtract 5 from the damage the Thrasher takes each time he is dealt damage from a physical attackusually weapons or natural attacks but not energy attacks (magical or nonmagical in origin, spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities). Ignore damage reduction if the damage is from a magic weapon or attack of +1 bonus or higher. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Damage reduction does not stack with itself unless otherwise statedif the Thrasher gains other forms of damage reduction, apply the best damage reduction for the situation. Damage reduction from the Thrasher class may stack with the Tough hero damage reduction tree; in this case add the benefit of those damage reductions for attacks from melee and ranged weapons.




     At 10th level, this damage reduction increases to 10/+1.
