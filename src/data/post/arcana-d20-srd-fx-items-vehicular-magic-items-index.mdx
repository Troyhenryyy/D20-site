## 
     Vehicular Magic Items
    



     This section describes several magic accessories for vehicles.
    



     A vehicular magic item functions only when it is properly placed on or within the vehicle: either attached to the vehicle in its proper place, painted on the vehicle, or incorporated into its design. Simply placing an item in the front seat will not activate the items magic effect. Removing the vehicular magic item from its intended location also ends the effect, although the item continues to radiate magic.
