### Class Features


The following features pertain to the Psionic Agent advanced class.


Psionic Skills
At 1st level, the Psionic Agent gains access to the Autohypnosis and Concentration skills, as described for the Battle Mind.


Psionic Powers
The Psionic Agents key talent is the ability to manifest psionics powers related to movement and detection.


A psionic power is a one-time psionic effect. Psionic powers require power points to use. Unlike arcane spellcasters, psionicists dont have spellbooks and they dont prepare powers ahead of time. A psionicists level limits the number of power points available for manifesting powers. In addition, a psionicist must have a key ability score equal to at least 10 + the powers level to manifest a particular power.  The Psionic Agents selection of psionic powers is extremely limited and tied both to detection and avoiding being detected. The Psionic Agent knows two 0-level powers (called talents) of your choice. At each level, the Psionic Agent discovers one or more previously latent powers, as indicated on the table below.


The DC for saving throws to resist a psionic power is 10 + the powers level + the Psionic Agents key ability modifier.


| Psionic Agent Level | Pts/Day | Powers Discovered by Level |  |  |  |  |
| :--------------------- | :---------: | :----------------------------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | --: |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 1 | 2 | 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 | 3 | 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 | 4 | 3 | 1 |  |  |  |
| 4 | 5 | 3 | 2 |  |  |  |
| 5 | 8 | 3 | 3 | 1 |  |  |
| 6 | 11 | 3 | 3 | 2 |  |  |
| 7 | 16 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |  |
| 8 | 21 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 |  |
| 9 | 26 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |  |
| 10 | 33 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |



A Psionic Agent can manifest a certain number of powers per day based on her available power points. (0-level powers have a special cost.) She just pays the power point cost of a power to manifest it, no preparation necessary. The base number of power points available per day is shown above.


Psionic Focus
At 2nd level, a Psionic Agent chooses two powers that share the same primary ability score, and adds +2 to the DC for all saving throws against those powers.


Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Psionic Agent gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Psionic Agent must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.


Athletic, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Double Tap, Exotic Melee Weapons Proficiency, Focused, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Shot on the Run, Skip Shot, Weapon Focus, as well as any metapsionic feats.


Draw Power
At 4th level, a Psionic Agent can spend an action point to regain a number of power points equal to her levels in this class. This is an attack action.


Charged Shot
At 5th level, a Psionic Agent may do additional damage with a ranged attack. Before making any single ranged attack, the Psionic Agent, as a free action,
spends a power point to charge a weapon. The next attack deals an extra 1d4 points of damage if it hits (if it misses, it deals no damage, and the power point is still spent). The Psionic Agent may spend multiple free actions and power points in a single round if she has multiple attacks, but may only charge each attack once. A shot remains charged for a number of rounds equal to her levels in this class.


Combat Manifestation
At 7th level, a Psionic Agent becomes adept at manifesting psionic powers in combat. She gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks to manifest a power while on the defensive.


Power Penetration
At 8th level, the Psionic Agents powers are more potent at breaking through power resistance (and spell resistance) of opponents. The Psionic Agent gains a +2 on manifester level checks to beat a creatures power resistance. For those campaigns where spell resistance and power resistance are equal, it applies to spell resistance as well.


Deadly Aim
At 10th level, the Psionic Agent is capable of using her abilities to strike at the chinks in the defense of opponent with a ranged weapon. At 10th level, the Psionic Agent may pay 5 power points to turn a ranged attack into a ranged touch attack.
