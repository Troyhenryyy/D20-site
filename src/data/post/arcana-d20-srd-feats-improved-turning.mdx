     Improved Turning




     Your turning or rebuke attempts are more powerful than normal.




     Prerequisites: Ability to turn or rebuke a creature type.





      Benefit:

     You gain a +2 bonus on your turning checks. This feat may be taken multiple times, though each time must be applied to a different creature type which you may normally turn.
