## 
     Extend Power [Metapsionic]
    



     You can manifest powers that last longer than normal.
    




      Benefit:
     
     An extended power lasts twice as long as normal. Powers with a concentration, instantaneous, or permanent duration are not extended. An extended power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +2.
