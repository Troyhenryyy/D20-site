### 
     Class Features
    



     The following features pertain to the Swashbuckler advanced class.
    



     Weapon Focus
    

     At 1st level, the Swashbuckler gets the Weapon Focus feat for a weapon which he has Weapon Finesse. If he already has Weapon Focus for this weapon, then he
gains Weapon Focus in another light melee weapon or smaller of his choice.
    



     Quick Weapon Draw
    

     At 2nd level, the Swashbuckler gains the ability to draw his weapon as a free action. This applies only to the weapons for which the Swashbuckler has Weapon Focus.
    



     Bonus Feats
    

     At 3rd, 6th, and 9th levels, the Swashbuckler gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Swashbuckler must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it. Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Exotic Melee Weapon Proficiency, Improved Damage Threshold, Improved Disarm, Improved Trip, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack.
    



     Weapon Specialization
    

     At 4th level, the Swashbuckler gains the Weapon Specialization feat. He gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls with a chosen light slashing or piercing melee weapon.
    



     The Swashbuckler must have Weapon Focus in that weapon in order to gain Weapon Specialization.
    



     Find the Mark
    

     The Swashbuckler increases his threat range by one when using any melee weapon with which he has Weapon Finesse. A weapon that would threaten a critical on 20 would now do so on a 19 or 20, and one which threatens on a 19 or 20 would now do so on an 18 to 20. This ability works with other abilities which increase
threat ranges.
    



     Greater Weapon Specialization
    

     At 7th level, the Swashbuckler gains Greater Weapon Specialization with a light or smaller melee weapon with which he has Weapon Specialization. This ability increases the bonus on damage rolls to +4 when using the selected weapon.
    



     Deflect Missiles
    

     At 8th level, the Swashbuckler can use his weapon to deflect missiles in the air, including arrows, spears, bolts, and bullets. This is a supernatural ability and costs an action point to activate.
    



     If armed with a melee weapon with which he has Greater Weapon Specialization, the Swashbuckler may spend an action point to allow a Reflex save (DC 20 +1 per enhancement bonus of the attacking weapon). If he succeeds, he deflects the missile harmlessly away. The Deflect Missiles ability applies to bullets from handguns and longarms, but not exceptional missiles (such as magic missiles or particularly large items). If used successfully against a grenade attack the grenade automatically scatters (as normal rules) and then explodes.
    



     Touché
    

     At 10th level, the Swashbuckler is so adept are using his chosen weapon (with which he has Greater Weapon Focus) that attacks with that weapon can deal additional damage. With a successful attack with this weapon, before damage is rolled, he can spend 1 action point to deal +3d6 points of damage. This damage is not doubled by the effects of critical hits.
