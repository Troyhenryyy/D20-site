## Jack Of All Trades

Youve picked up a smattering of even the most obscure skills.

Prerequisite: Character level 8th+.

Benefit: You can use any skill untrained, even those that normally require training and those that are exclusive to classes you dont have. You cannot, however, gain ranks in a skill unless you are allowed to select it.
