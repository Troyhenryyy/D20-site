     Class Features




     The following features pertain to the Mystic advanced class.




     Arcane Skills


     At 1st level, the Mystic gains the Arcane Skills feat, granting access to the following skills: Spellcraft, Use Magic Device, and the arcane functions of

Concentration and Craft (chemical).

     Divine Spells


     The Mystic casts divine spells the same as Acolytes. A Mystics selection of spells is extremely limited. The Mystic begins play knowing four 0-level spells (called orisons) and two 1st-level spells. At each level, the mystic gains one or more new spells as indicated below). These spells can be common spells chosen from the Mystics spell list or they can be unusual spells of the Mystics own devising.




     The Mystic is limited to casting a certain number of spells of each level per day, but need not prepare those spells in advance. The number of spells that may be cast per day may be increased by sufficiently high Charisma scores.




     A Mystic may use a higher-level slot to cast a lower-level spell. The Mystic may spend an action point to trade out a known spell (losing it entirely) in exchange for another; in this fashion the Mystic is not penalized for filling all the slots of their known spells list.




     Mystics do not have cure or inflict spells in their spell lists. Mystic may use incantations to cast these spells. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against the Mystics spell is 10 + the spells level + the Mystics Wisdom modifier. The Mystic doesnt acquire her spells from books or scrolls, nor does she prepare them through study. Instead, she meditates or prays for her spells, receiving them through her own strength of faith or as divine inspiration. The Mystic must spend one hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on the Mystics spell preparation. In addition, the Mystic receives bonus spells based on her Wisdom score, as shown on the chart below.




     Spell List: Mystics use the same spell list as Acolytes except that Mystics may not use the spells listed below.




     0-level: Cure minor wounds, inflict minor wounds




     1st-level: Cure light wounds, inflict light wounds




     2nd-level: Cure moderate wounds, inflict moderate wounds




     3rd-level: Cure serious wounds, inflict serious wounds




     4th-level: Cure critical wounds, inflict critical wounds




     5th-level: Mass cure light wounds, mass inflict light wounds, raise dead

     Turn or Rebuke Undead


     Starting at 2nd level, the Mystic gains the supernatural ability to affect the undead, such as zombies, skeletons, ghosts, and vampires in a manner similar to Acolyte. However, the Mystics allegiance does not effect the type of effects she has on the undead. Furthermore, the Mystic affects undead as if she were an Acolyte of one level lower than her current Mystic class.




     A Mystic may turn, rebuke, command or bolster the undead. She may destroy the undead if of sufficient levels. She cannot dispel the turning of an Acolyte.




     Bonus Feats


     At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Mystic gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Mystic must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it. Alertness, Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Armor Proficiency (light), Attentive, Creative, Dodge, Educated, Empower Turning, Greater Spell Focus, Greater Spell Penetration, Improved Turning, Renown, Spell Focus, Spell Penetration, Trustworthy, Windfall. The Mystic may also take any metamagic feats as bonus feats.




     Combat Casting


     At 4th level, the Mystic becomes adept at casting spells during combat. She gets a +4 bonus to Concentration checks made to cast a spell while on the defensive.




     Brew Potion


     At 5th level, the Mystic can create potions, which carry spells within themselves.



      The Mystic can create a potion of any spell of 3rd level or lower that she knows. The spell must target a character or characters. Brewing a potion takes one day. When the Mystic creates a potion, she sets the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than the

Mystics own level.

      The purchase DC of the raw material to brew a potion is 15 + the potions spell level + the potions caster level.




      The Mystic must also spend experience points to brew a potion. The XP cost is equal to the spell level x the caster level x the purchase DC of the raw materials.




      Finally, the Mystic makes a Craft (chemical) skill check. The DC for the check is 10 + the spell level + the caster level. If the check fails, the raw materials are used up but the XP are not spent. The Mystic can try again the next day.




      When the Mystic creates a potion, she makes any choices that she would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell. Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an experience point cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the raw materials cost, the Mystic must expend the material component or pay the XP cost when creating the potion.




      Discern Lie


      The Mystic develops the ability to gauge whether another character is telling the truth by reading facial expressions and interpreting body language. The Mystic must be able to see and hear (but not necessarily understand) the individual under scrutiny.




      The Mystic can determine whether a spoken statement is true or false with a successful Sense Motive check opposed by the subjects Bluff check or DC 10, whichever is greater.




      Turn or Rebuke Humans


      Starting at 8th level, the Mystic gains the supernatural ability to affect humans, allowing her to command them or drive them off in the fashion of the Acolytes turn undead ability. The Mystics allegiance does not effect the type of effects she has on humans. The ability does not affect humanoids or other creatures. Unlike other turning abilities, the Mystic must spend an action point to turn or rebuke humans.




      A Mystic may turn, rebuke, command or bolster humans. She cannot destroy the targeted humans with this ability, nor can she dispel the turning of another individual.




      Empower Spell


      At 10th level, the Mystic learns to cast spells to greater effect. All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by one-half. An empowered spell deals half again as much damage as normal, cures half again as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, as appropriate. Spells without random variables are not affected. An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spells actual level. Therefore, a Mystic can only empower 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level spells.
