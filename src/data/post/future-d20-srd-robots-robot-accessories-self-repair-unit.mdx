## 
    Self-Repair Unit (PL 7)
   



    A self-repair unit enables a robot to repair itself by replacing damaged parts with cannibalized or replicated ones. A robot with a self-repair unit can spend 1 hour repairing itself; this automatically restores 1d10 points of damage (no Repair check necessary). A robot cannot use this unit to repair another robot.
