## 
     Robot
    



     Robots are manufactured, remote-controlled constructs powered by batteries. These highly useful machines come in a variety of sizes and shapes and can be fitted with tools or weapons. Techies create robotsfor rules on this process, refer to the Techie advanced class.
    


### 
     Species Traits
    



     Construct: Robots have the traits and immunities common to constructs.
    



     Speed: A robots speed depends on its size and method of locomotion (bipedal, quadrupedal, tracked, or wheeled). The different speeds are given with each robots statistics (below).
    



     Attacks: A robot is not normally equipped with weapons. Robots fitted with arms or similar manipulators can attempt to grapple things, but only robots of Medium-size or larger can use their manipulators to deal damage.
    




      Skills:
     
     A character with four or more levels in the Techie advanced class can program one or more ranks of a single skill into a robot; otherwise, the robot has no skills.
    


### 
     Building a Robot
    



     Follow these two steps to create Small or Medium-size robots.
    



     1. Wealth Check: The purchase DC for the components needed to construct a robot is based on its size category.
    



     Make a Wealth check to purchase and gather the necessary components before starting construction.
    


| Size | Purchase DC |
| :------ | -------------: |
| Small | 21 |
| Medium-size | 24 |




     2. Construct Frame: The robots body determines its size, shape, locomotion, and hit points. The DC of the required Craft (mechanical) check is set by the robots size and modified by the mode of locomotion selected (see the Techie advanced class description).
    


| Size | Craft (mechanical) DC |
| :------ | -----------------------: |
| Small | 18 |
| Medium-size | 21 |




     In addition to the external components noted in the Techie advanced class description, a Techie can add additional components, weapons, and armor plating to a robot. Refer to the table below to find the DC modifier for adding new components to a robot.
    


| Components | DC Modifier |
| :------------ | -------------: |
|  |  |
| Articulated frame | +5 |
|  |  |
| Accessory mount | +1 |
| Loading mechanism | +2 |
| Basic toolkit | +2 |
| Basic electrical kit | +2 |
| Searchlight | +1 |
|  |  |
| Natural armor bonus +2 | +2* |




     *This component can be purchased a number of times equal to the robots size category (counted up from Diminutive).
    



     Articulated Frame: This robots body is articulated so that it can move like a snake, slithering through narrow openings and navigating stairs with ease. A robot with this frame moves as fast as a bipedal robot, but it can also move through difficult terrain and small spaces without slowing.
    



     Accessory Mount: A robot with an accessory mount can be armed with a single weapon or accessory up to one size category larger than itself. Such a robot can fire a weapon using its normal attack modifier or via a remote, using the operators attack modifier with a 4 penalty. Alternatively, an accessory mount can hold a single grenade, or nearly any of the items on Table: General Equipment.
    



     Loading Mechanism: A robot with a loading mechanism can reload a single weapon with a full-round action. The mechanism holds enough ammunition to reload the weapon three times, and it works with weapons that use box ammunition, speed-loaders (but not loose bullets), a grenade launcher round, or some sort of fuel tank (such as a flamethrower). A robot can have multiple loading mechanisms, one for each weapon that it has mounted in its frame.
    



     Toolkits: A robot can use a toolkit if it has the appropriate skill or can use the operators skill at a 2 penalty via remote control.
    



     Searchlight: A searchlight operates in the same manner as a battery flood spotlight.
