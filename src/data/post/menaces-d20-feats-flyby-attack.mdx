     Flyby Attack




     The creature can attack on the wing.




     Prerequisite: Fly speed.




     Benefit: When flying, the creature can take a move action (including a dive) and another partial action at any point during the move. The creature cannot take a second move action during a round when it makes a flyby attack.




     Normal: Without this feat, a creature can take a partial action either before or after its move.
