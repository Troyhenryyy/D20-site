## 
     Incantation Definitions
    



     The following terms are used extensively in this section of the chapter:
    



     Incantation: Powerful ritual magic that requires successful Knowledge (arcane lore) checks to cast. Incantations dont require spellcasting ability, dont take up spell slots, cant be improved using metamagic feats, and need not be prepared ahead of time.
    



     Factor: An aspect of the incantation thats built in when the incantation is designed. Casters have no control over factors; theyre an indelible part of the incantation. When a GM designs an incantation, factors are useful ways to customize an incantation.
    



     Option: Aspects of the incantation that make it easier or harder, depending on choices the caster makes. Options provide modifiers to the casters Knowledge (arcane lore) check.
    



     Seed: The building blocks of incantation, seeds describe magical effects in general terms.
