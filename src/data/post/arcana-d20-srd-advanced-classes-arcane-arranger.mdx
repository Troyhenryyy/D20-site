      Class Features




      The following features pertain to the Arcane Arranger advanced class.




      Word on the Street


      The Arcane Arranger filters information constantly and remembers everything. Through regular contacts, gossip, internet chats, and other situations, he has a deep knowledge of everyday things. The Arcane Arranger can make a Gather Information check on general or specific information instantaneously, and spends only an hour making a Gather Information check for restricted information. Retries may be made under normal rules.




      Protected information still requires 1d4+1 hours for a check.




      The purchase DC for using Gather Information is reduced by 10.




      False Allegiance


      The Arcane Arranger fits in with whatever group he chooses to be with. At 2nd level, the Arcane Arranger can successfully emulate an allegiance he knows about. He gains the +2 circumstance bonus on Charisma-based skills when dealing with an individual of the same allegiance. The allegiance and its bonus is considered in effect until a check is failed, at which point the false allegiance is revealed. Supernatural and spell-like abilities that determine allegiance are not affected by the Arcane Arrangers false allegiance ability.




      Bonus Feats


      At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Arcane Arranger gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Arcane Arranger must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.




      Arcane Skills, Armor Proficiency (light), Attentive, Builder, Combat Expertise, Educated, Gearhead, Improved Disarm, Jack of All Trades, Renown, Studious, Trustworthy, Windfall.




      Shadow Resources


      At 4th level, the Arcane Arranger is well-enough wired into the social system to be able to get the names and numbers of individuals with particular abilities and talents. Even if away from his home stomping ground a phone call can produce a contact with the needed resource. Make a level check, adding all Arcane Arranger levels and any levels of Charismatic Hero. The difficulty of this task is based on how common the required abilities are:


| Common Skill (Ride, Pilot, Treat Injury)                                                                                         |                   DC 10 |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| Uncommon Skill (subgroups of other skills such as Knowledge (arcane lore) or Craft (structural))                                 |                   DC 15 |
| Rare Skill (skills available for a particular classSpellcraft, Psicraft, Use Magic Device)                                       |                   DC 20 |
| Specific Feat                                                                                                                    |                   DC 20 |
| Class Feature (spellcasting, turn undead, psionics)                                                                              |                   DC 20 |
| Specific Combination of Skills, Feats, and Abilities (someone with Knowledge (business) and the ability to cast the auguryspell) |                   DC 25 |
| Finding someone willing to perform activities secretly or illegally                                                              |                   DC +5 |
| Finding someone with a specific level of ability                                                                                 | Add desired ranks to DC |

      A successful check indicates that the individual is available, and the Arcane Arranger knows about him. It does not guarantee the character contacted will be willing to perform the requested servicethe party requesting the service must still negotiate for that persons services. An unsuccessful check means that no such individual is immediately known or available to the Arcane Arranger. This does not negate trying again for a different skill, nor from trying to locate a skill resource through more traditional methods. The resource the Arcane Arranger knows about will have total ranks in the needed skill of at least the Arcane Arrangers total character level +3.




      Pack Rat


      At 5th level, the Arcane Arranger is considered to have considerable material resources either at hand or easily and cheaply acquired. When making a Wealth check to determine if a particular item is at hand, add the Arcane Arranger class levels as a circumstance bonus.




      Expert in Your Field


      At 7th level, the Arcane Arranger is considered a master of connections, such that his reputation precedes him in his dealings with others. The Arcane Arranger gains a circumstance bonus equal to his Reputation bonus when making skill checks that are directly involved with Gather Information and Diplomacy skills. In addition, the Arcane Arranger may add his Reputation bonus on Wealth checks for new purchases.




      Up My Sleeve


      At 8th level, the Arcane Arranger gains the supernatural ability to pull a specific item out of thin air. As a move action, the Arcane Arranger may cause any item currently in his possession (with a size no greater than Small) to disappear into an extra-dimensional space. The item becomes impossible to detect by any means, however detect magical aura spells will reveal a moderate magical aura around the hand that last held the item. As a move action, the Arcane Arranger can cause the item to reappear in his hand. The Arcane Arranger may only hide one item at a time in this fashion.




      At 10th level, the Arcane Arranger may use this ability to hide a single object of up to Large size or up to three objects of up to Small size (each of which may be retrieved individually).
