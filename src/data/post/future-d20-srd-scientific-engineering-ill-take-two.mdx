## Ill Take Two


One of the simplest processes using matter replication is the duplication of an existing object. In fact, duplication machines are far more common in most settings than full-fledged replicators because they dont require the storage of massive amounts of blueprints.


Replacing the databank of blueprints are advanced sensors that analyze the construction of an object and transform the collected data into a blueprint of the object. Once the scanning process is complete, the replicator produces a copy of the desired object just as quickly as creating it from a stored blueprint. The duplication machine does not store blueprints, and so each object must be scanned before duplication can occur.
