## Forced Air (PL 5)


The robot takes in air through a vent and forces it out beneath itself, allowing it to hover about an inch off the ground. It handles poorly and moves at half speed over poor surface conditions.


Base Speed: Fly 30 feet (clumsy).


Purchase DC: One-half the base purchase DC of the robotÂ’s frame.
